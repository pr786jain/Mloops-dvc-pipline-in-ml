 URL september NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER a m the wages of september NUMBER there is no going back september NUMBER changed our world those who deny such a watershed event take a superficially short

NUMBER NUMBER americans all seen live in real time by millions the world over tore off a scab and exposed deep wounds which if and when they heal will leave ugly scars for decades the killers dealt in icons the choice of NUMBER as the date of death targeting the manifest symbols of global capitalism and american military power and centering their destruction on the largest jewish city in the world yes they got their symbols in spades but they have no idea that their killing has instead become emblematic of changes that they could scarcely imagine islamic fundamentalism has proved not ascendant but static morally repugnant and the worst plague upon the arab world since the crusades by lurking in the shadows and killing incrementally through stealth the vampirish terrorists garnered bribes and subsidies through threats and bombs but pale and wrinkled in the daylight after NUMBER NUMBER they prove only ghoulish not fearsome the more the world knows of al qaeda and bin laden the more it has found them both vile and yet banal and so is confident and eager to eradicate them and all they stand for it is one thing to kill innocents quite another to take on the armed might of an aroused united states easily dodging a solo cruise missile in the vastness of afghanistan may make good theater and bring about braggadocio dealing with grim american and british commandos who have come NUMBER NUMBER miles for your head prompts abject flight and an occasional cheap infomercial on the run and the ultimate consequence of the attacks of september NUMBER will not merely be the destruction of al qaeda but also the complete repudiation of the taliban the iranian mullocracy the plague of the pakistani madrassas and any other would be fundamentalist paradise on earth foreign relations will not be the same in our generation our coalition with europe we learn was not a partnership but more mere alphabetic nomenclature and the mutual back scratching of euro american globetrotters a paper alliance without a mission nearly NUMBER years after the end of the cold war the truth is that europe out of noble purposes for a decade has insidiously eroded its collective national sovereignty in order to craft an antidemocratic eu a NUMBER NUMBER person fuzzy bureaucracy whose executive power is as militarily weak as it is morally ambiguous in its reliance on often dubious international accords this sad realization september NUMBER brutally exposed and we all should cry for the beloved continent that has for the moment completely lost its moral bearings indeed as the months progressed the problems inherent in the european way became all too apparent pretentious utopian manifestos in lieu of military resoluteness abstract moralizing to excuse dereliction of concrete ethical responsibility and constant american ankle biting even as europe lives in a make believe shire while we keep back the forces of mordor from its picturesque borders with only a few brave frodos and bilbos tagging along nothing has proved more sobering to americans than the skepticism of these blinkered european hobbits after september NUMBER america learned that moderate arab countries are as dangerous as hostile islamic nations after september NUMBER being a saudi egyptian or kuwaiti means nothing special to an american at least not proof of being any more friendly or hostile than having libyan syrian or lebanese citizenship indeed our entire postwar policy of propping up autocracies on the triad of their anticommunism oil and arms purchases like nato belongs to a pre NUMBER NUMBER age of soviet aggrandizement and petroleum monopolies now we learn that broadcasting state sponsored hatred of israel and the united states is just as deadly to our interests as scud missiles and as likely to come from friends as enemies worst case scenarios like iran and afghanistan offer more long term hope than stable regimes like the saudis governments that hate us have populations that like us and vice versa the saudi royal family whom NUMBER NUMBER american troops protect and the mubarak autocracy which has snagged billions of american dollars are as afraid of democratic reformers as they are islamic fundamentalists and with good reason islamic governments in iran and under the taliban were as hated by the masses as arab secular reformers in exile in the west are praised and championed the post NUMBER NUMBER domestic calculus is just as confusing generals and the military brass call civilians who seek the liberation of iraq chicken hawks and worse yet such traditional vietnam era invective i think rings hollow after september NUMBER and sounds more like mcclellan s shrillness against his civilian overseers who precipitously wanted an odious slavery ended than resonant of patton s audacity in charging after murderous nazis more americans were destroyed at work in a single day than all those soldiers killed in enemy action since the evacuation of vietnam nearly NUMBER years ago indeed most troops who went through the ghastly inferno of vietnam are now in or nearing retirement and thank god there is no generation of americans in the present military other than a few thousand brave veterans of the gulf mogadishu and panama who have been in sustained and deadly shooting with heavy casualties because american soldiers and their equipment are as impressive as our own domestic security is lax in this gruesome war it may well be more perilous to work high up in lower manhattan fly regularly on a jumbo jet or handle mail at the pentagon or cia than be at sea on a sub or destroyer real concern for the sanctity of life may hinge on employing rather than rejecting force inasmuch as our troops are as deadly and protected abroad as our women children aged and civilians are impotent and vulnerable at home it seems to me a more moral gamble to send hundreds of pilots into harm s way than allow a madman to further his plots to blow up or infect thousands in high rises politics have been turned upside down in the old days cynical conservatives were forced to hold their noses and to practice a sometimes repellent realpolitik in the age of russian expansionism they were loathe to champion democracy when it might usher in a socialist trojan horse whose belly harbored totalitarians disguised as parliamentarians thus they were so often at loggerheads with naïve and idealist leftists no longer the end of the specter of a deadly and aggressive soviet communism has revived democratic ideology as a force in diplomacy champions of freedom no longer sigh and back opportunistic rightist thugs who promise open economics loot their treasuries and keep out the russians instead even reactionaries are now more likely to push for democratic governments in the middle east than are dour and skeptical leftists the latter if multiculturalists often believe that democracy is a value neutral western construct not necessarily a universal good if pacifists they claim nonintervention not justice as their first priority the right not the left now is the greater proponent of global freedom liberation and idealism with obvious domestic ramifications for any republican president astute enough to tap that rich vein of popular support all this and more are the wages of the disaster of september NUMBER and the subsequent terrible year and yet it is likely that for good or evil we will see things even more incredible in the twelve months ahead ,0

url URL date not supplied feedback from my posting NUMBER about fogbugz NUMBER setup fell into four categories why make setup reversable instead you should collect all the information from the user and make all the changes in one batch at the end there are a couple of things to understand here first of all even if you do everything in one batch at the end there s always a possibility that some step in the middle of the batch will fail and in that case a well behaved setup program will back out the steps that were already done there are well over NUMBER error messages in the string table for fogbugz setup so the number of things that can fail is not insignificant second it s not nice to tell people about an error in their input three pages after they made the mistake for example early in the fogbugz setup process we prompt you to create an account for fogbugz to use img URL fogbugz setup screenshot the account creation could fail for a myriad of reasons none of which can be predicted before trying to create the account for example the password might not conform to the system password policy and different national versions of windows nt have different rules about accented letters in passwords betcha didn t know that it s better to tell the user about this problem right away so they can correct their input rather than having a message come up during the long install process later forcing the user to back up and fix it and even if you force the user to back up and fix it you still have to undo the first part of the work that you did before creating the account otherwise you ve left their system in an indeterminate state in any case i need to write code to create the account and delete the account in case something later fails i might as well call that code on this page of the wizard where i can display a useful error message and what are the kinds of things that need to be reversable well in order to upgrade fogbugz without requiring a reboot and we _never ever _require a reboot we have to shut down a couple of processes that might have been keeping fogbugz files pinned down such as iis microsoft s web server so part one of the batch is stop iis now if part NUMBER fails for some reason it would be _extremely_ rude to leave iis not running and anyway it s not like i don t need to write the code for start iis for the end of the batch so the code to rollback stop iis is already written no big deal i just need to call it at the right place i think one reason that people think you should gather all the info and then do all the work is because with very large installation programs that are very slow this is a polite way to waste less of the user s time indeed even fogbugz setup does NUMBER of its work at the very end but the create account operation is so fast that principle simply doesn t apply here even our NUMBER of the work phase takes well under a minute most of which is spent waiting for iis to stop and start why did you use vc mfc surely an advanced intelligence such as yourself has admitted by now that delphi NUMBER is more productive first of all leave your language religious fanaticism at the usenet door somehow i managed to figure out_ in high school_ that language advocacy and religious arguments are unbelievably boring secondly even if delphi were more productive the only pertinent question since i am writing the code is _what is more productive for joel spolsky_ and i don t know delphi at all but i know winNUMBER mfc and vc _really really well_ so while i might not outcode a good delphi programmer i would definitely outcode a completely inexperienced delphi programmer which is me certainly over a short NUMBER week project third many of the things i needed to do in this setup program are things like grant the logon as service privilege to an account this is rare enough that the only way to find out how to do this is to search the microsoft knowlege base and the web in general when you search the web in general for how to do fancy things with windows nt what you find is about NUMBER c code maybe NUMBER vb code and NUMBER everything else yes i know i could translate the c code into delphi assuming i was a sophisticated delphi programmer not a completely inexperienced delphi programmer but that costs as much productivity as i would supposedly gain from your supposedly more productive programming language and fourth i already had about NUMBER of the code i needed for setup in mfc format from fogbugz NUMBER NUMBER setup and a library i ve been using for years to make wizards why make setup at all you already have your customers money good setup programs don t increase sales this was actually the smartest question and made me think the hardest i came up with three reasons decreased tech support cost this setup program will pay for itself over the life of the code delight my customers when i m trying to get them to upgrade to NUMBER NUMBER i want them to remember how

i did something crudely along those lines for vms vax maybe NUMBER years ago there is at least one product that does it for pc though i don t recall its name it is also handy for cases where you have a cd image of some filesystem or some other image of a filesystem that is intrinsically readonly but whose filesystem will not accept or is not graceful readonly storage it is also more or less necessary if you want to work with worm file structures which are older still there have been a number of filesystems for those dating back to the early NUMBERs if not before a generic facility of the type you mention is also one way to implement snapshots on top of an existing filesystem the written information must obviously be seekable so you can provide the illusion that you wrote to the storage a device level implementation is however perfectly adequate it does not of course distinguish for you what should have been changed and what should not if you truly know a device or perhaps a partition must not be written it can be simpler to either return error on writes or to just return a fake success on writes yet discard the data ntfs lives with the latter strategy just fine from my experiments i have not tried it on extfNUMBER or reiser btw think about your mention of raid and consider the complexity of writing to raidNUMBER or raidNUMBER i would contend that with cheaper storage these days it makes little sense to use raid save for shadowing and possibly striping those at least do not have the complexity and slowup dangers that higher raid levels have and there is not a need to save the cost of disk so much where a single disk may hold NUMBER gigs and up why not dedicate another whole disk to fault recovery and lose the complexity and slow write sometimes of raid glenn everhart original message from bmord URL mailto bmord URL sent tuesday september NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER pm to webappsec securityfocus com secprog securityfocus subject use of base image delta image for automated recovery from attacks hi i was inspired by a mode of operation supported by vmware you can have a base disk image shared by multiple virtual machine vm instances that base image is never altered by a vm instance instead each vm instance writes changes to its own redo log future hard disk reads from that vm instance incorporate both the base image and the appropriate redo log to present the current disk image for that specific virtual machine this is described here thanks to duane for providing this link on the honeypots mailing list URL could this basic concept be used to easily make self fixing client server applications that efficiently and automatically recover from most attacks even before those attacks have been discovered here is what i imagine the physical architectures of most production client server systems are layered for example your basic web application might have a web server running apache connected to an application server running some jNUMBERee or net business logic connected to a database server for persistence the only one of these whose disk image really should evolve over time is the database server and even here you often put the static rdbms software on one partition and the changeable datafiles on another partition it is only the partition with the volatile datafiles that must be allowed to change from one boot to the next other paritions may need to be writable for say swap space but these changes could be eliminated on each reboot when someone cracks this system they will probably change an image that shouldn t be changed e g they might leverage a buffer overflow in iis or apache to install a trojan or a backdoor on the more exposed web server but what if the web server ran off a base image writing changes to a delta or redo partition and then what if every night it automatically erased the redo partition and rebooted the downtime involved for each machine would be minimal because it is only deleting data rather than restoring from backup in a system with redundant web servers for load balancing or high availability this could be scheduled in a way such that the system is always accessible this base redo partition concept could be implemented at the same level as a feature of hardware raid allowing for greater performance reliability and hack resistance this concept could also be applied to the application servers and even the database server partitions except for those partitions which contain the table data files of course does anyone do this already or is this a new concept or has this concept been discussed before and abandoned for some reasons that i don t yet know i use the physical architecture of a basic web application as an example in this post but this concept could of course be applied to most server systems it would allow for the hardware separation of volatile and non volatile disk images it would be analogous to performing nightly ghosting operations only it would be more efficient and involve less or no downtime thanks for any opinions ben this transmission may contain information that is privileged confidential and or exempt from disclosure under

 if the text recognition algorithm architecture humans use is anything like the algorithm structure we ve been working with the reason the first letter and to a lesser extent the last letter is important is that without it the text pattern recognition problem is exponentially more difficult from a theoretical standpoint anyway and has to be resolved using deeper abstraction analysis the middle letters are far less important and computationally much easier to resolve correctly i think keeping the number of middle letters consistent with the correct spelling is important would be interesting to see if this same effect is applicable to written forms of other languages maybe even japanese romongi bill ,0

 i have translated the article in full see end of post i think that i ve done a far better job than the google translation at least it s readable now any corrections appreciated stuff in s is my and others additions to the debate my apologies if i ve paraphrased anybody incorrectly i will be glad to retract if anyone is miffed the article makes four main points NUMBER absence of critical clauses in this case the idea is that the licence is invalid because it doesn t specify under what country s law the gpl is governed NUMBER specification in english only that for the end user as opposed to businesses the gpl doesn t apply because it s not written in french NUMBER arbitary licence change the point here is that under french law the author can change the terms of the licence arbitarily this is because any granting of rights by an author must be clearly delimited in terms of how long where to whom dates and times in the absence of such limitations the original author has the right to change his software back to closed on a whim david neary makes the point that the copyright holder automatically retains the right to change the licence scott replies it simply requires authorisation from all copyright holders that s not my understanding french law allows a gpl type licence _on condition_ that the specific conditions of the granting of such rights are clear if they are not there is nothing to stop the original author taking back his work the lawyers see this correctly imho as a weakness in the gpl NUMBER hidden defects roughly this clause means that the author s is are liable for any defects if the consumer is not an it engineer so if linux blows up and data is lost then the authors are liable ciaran johnson says that m oft and others have similar clauses the point here is that they are _all_ invalid just that this one affects the gpl also niall o broinn makes the point that it is not a sale but rather a service leasing arrangement and that s why it doesn t come under this point i would suggest that the whole thrust of this article has been to see software sales even if no money changes hands as governed very much by consumer law in france anyway rick moen makes the point that it is not a sale but rather a granting of rights which are not default see the bit about even the granting of rights by an author having to be explicitly specified under french law the fact that two ip lawyers in france think that the gpl is covered as a sale make me feel that there is a de facto sale and a de facto contract NUMBER roughly there may be other reasons under french law why the gpl may be invalid whole article freedom a is worth more than these imperfect licences specialised lawyers look at the gpl lawyer cyril rojinsky duly appointed to the court and the jurist vincent grynbaum both specialised in the area of intellectual property examine the free licences and in particular the gpl they have published their study in the review proprietes intellectuelles intellectual property NUMBER and their conclusion is grim their approach is interesting the problem for them is not to know whether freedom is valid under french law for them the question is a moot point but rather they asked themselves about the form and the content of the text of free licences and in particular the gpl the problem is not free programmes but rather the licence contracts of free programmes absence of critical clauses the authors tell us that first of all the reference to copyright is not legally sufficient in the framework of international contracts which is the case of licence contracts for programmes developed and spread via the internet the idea of copyright can basically include differences from one country to another this is why under international contracts it is necessary to specify to which laws one is referring french law american c the authors only found three public licences which were correctly formulated on this point qpl ibm public licence and the mozilla public licence specification in the english language next the authors remind us that at least in france no clause in a contract may be contrary to french law NUMBER however it turns out that a licence such as the gpl is contrary to french law in several respects firstly it is written in english and the fsf doesn t officially approve translations the toubon law obliges this sort of contract to be written in french including for businesses since the notion of user applies not only to consumers but also to businesses professionals c contacted by the editors of linuxfrench lawyer cyril rojinsky declared that as far as business is concerned the toubon law is probably doomed to change since it is in contradiction of european directives on the subject but whatever about that the problem is still valid for individuals and while waiting for it french law to change french companies have to deal with it since it is the law of the land a programme under the gpl can suddenly change licence another problem much more serious is that according to french law the author of a free programme can at any time invoke the invalidity of the licence for this software by simply changing the licence in effect the law of intellectual property stipulates that the granting of rights by the author is subordinate to the condition that each of these granted rights be the object of a distinct clause in the granting act i e the licence and that the granting of any such rights be delimited with respect to its scope and its grantees and also with respect to its location i e where such rights may be excersised and duration of any such grants NUMBER this is not the case of the gpl nor of other free licences briefly this means that in france or elsewhere if the author is french that which is under the gpl could revert to proprietary from one day to the next the problem of the guarantee hidden defects an other very serious flaw is that of the guarantee the gpl licences and others show that the software is delivered without guarantee you are going to immediately reply that commercical programmes carry the same clause in their licence contracts and this is correct however whatever is written in a licence contract one cannot free oneself from the guarantee from hidden defects since it is imposed in the civil code this concept is poorly understood by the layman it protects the buyer whoever it may be individual or business since it specifies the civil code and not consumer protection law against hidden defects deliberate or made in good faith by the seller for example if one buys a pair of socks in a sale and the shop has a notice specifying that sale items are neither refunded nor exchanged and on arriving home you notice that one of the socks has a hole in it several scenarios are possible you could have checked the socks before purchase the flaw is deemed obvious and you can sing for your money you couldn t check the socks they were packaged for example and in this case despite the notice neither refund nor exchange you may invoke hidden defect and have them changed or obtain a refund it s up to you personally i have already invoked in shops the hidden defect clause and it always worked well shopkeepers are always very cooperative if you quote a couple of words of the civil code the concept of hidden defect is rather wide it is necessary that you hadn t the possibility of discovering the defect before buying the product and then according to the civil code that you wouldn t have bought it at that price if you had known about the defect the third case which is much rarer is if you are able to show that the vendor had knowledge of the defect hidden but didn t inform you in this case not only does he have to reimburse the product but all expenses incurred by the sale metro tickets to go to the shop the fuse which blew when you plugged it in c this idea of hidden defect applies to all products including programmes this was made abundantly clear by the authorities and the courts surrounding yNUMBERk this is particularly inconvenient for free programmes since a site which offers a linux distro for download is supposed to provide a guarantee against hidden flaws linuxfrench asked cyril rojinsky if in the case of a free programme one could speak about a hidden defect since the source code was available he replied actually concerning the guarantee the question of obvious defect will arise this analyis will be different depending on whether the person who downloads the distribution is an it professional or not opensource has this advantage over the proprietary programme it protects the distributor against a guarantee of hidden defect insofar as the buy is an it person but for distribution to the public at large the problem remains the same roughly speaking lawyer cyril rojinsky said it himself this study is far from being exhaustive and many other areas could be explored during this interview we asked ourselves for example about the fragility of the gpl clause which forbids linking source code under the gpl with proprietary code in effect the laws of intellectual property give the right to the user to modify a programme with the intention of permitting interoperability with another programme if for that i need to link with a proprietary library communication protocol device driver i may consider as null and void this clause of the gpl the conclusion of this study is a wake up call for the community freedom merits more than these shoddy licences which should be modified before court cases over them proliferate and put at risk the undeniable originality of this effort NUMBER une publication de l institut de recherche en propriété intellectuelle noNUMBER juillet NUMBER NUMBER une telle clause

 wishful thinking people are just bigger dickheads now culture is changing and it is becoming acceptable to get in peoples face and shout them down when you disagree with them the people that do this are not disenfranchised they get their rocks off on being disagreeable assholes the act of protesting is more important than the actual issue being protested for most of these people ob in my experience this is classic american behaviour and i don t ob think its on the increase outside of the us of a ob i am willing to accept the premise that americans are bigger dickheads ob then they used to be sighs right because americans are the only people capable of being assholes shit history keeps fucking up when they keep mentioning all the historical examples of dickhead ness that have proceeded the us after all we re the only country who gets unruly when it comes to issues thats why its always just the americans at those crazy wto meetings right owen best regards bitbitch mailto bitbitch URL ,0

 can t think of how i d be running afoul of the spam filters with this post so here s the second try kissinger s book _does america need a foreign policy _ provides a few handy abstractions the ultimate dilemma of the statesman is to strike a balance between values idealism and interests realism and occasionally between peace and justice also he views historical american approaches to foreign policy as a bundle of three fibers hamiltonian we should only get involved in foreign adventures to preserve balances of power wilsonian we should only get involved in foreign adventures to further democracy etc jacksonian we should never get involved in foreign adventures unless we re attacked then we go rambo he has tactfully left out the hard realists as for the rest i gather wilsonians play the idealists and hamiltonians act where values and interests intersect and jacksonians act only when values and interests overlap kissinger himself seems to be a hamiltonian much of the book is about how he thinks we ought to be shaping the balance of power in various foreign regions maybe i ve been too affected by kant but i can t see that such a strategy works unless one can count on a bismarck runnning it how lopsided does the us look if everyone tries to run a balance of power politics dave the road to empire leads to domestic decay because in time the claims of omnipotence erode domestic restraints no empire has avoided the road to caesarism unless like the british empire it devolved its power before this process could develop in long lasting empires every problem turns into a domestic issue which should be handled very differently from international ones because the outside world no longer provides a counterweight and as challenges grow more diffuse and increasingly remote from the historic domestic base internal struggles become ever more bitter and in time violent a deliberate quest for hegemony is the surest way to destroy the values that made the united states great kings and tyrants generically have followed the same power politics garner popular support by keeping potential oligarchs down in other traditions a king is a legitimate tyrant and a tyrant an illegitimate king in the us i d hope that we like samuel wouldn t naturally make such fine distinctions ,0

 URL the wall street journal september NUMBER NUMBER commentary rebuild at ground zero by larry silverstein earlier this month we new yorkers observed the solemn anniversary of the horrific events that befell our city on sept NUMBER NUMBER all of those who perished must never be forgotten the footprints of the fallen twin towers and a portion of the NUMBER acre site must be dedicated to a memorial and civic amenities that recall the sacrifices that were made there and the anguish that those senseless acts of terror created for the victims families and indeed for all of us but for the good of the city and the region the NUMBER million plus square feet of commercial and retail space that was destroyed with the twin towers must be replaced on the site about NUMBER NUMBER people worked in the world trade center those jobs are lost along with those of another NUMBER NUMBER people who worked in the vicinity together those jobs in lower manhattan for which the trade center was the economic stimulus produced annual gross wages of about NUMBER billion or NUMBER of the annual gross wages earned in the entire state some of the firms have relocated elsewhere in the city and region but many have not new york city is facing a budget deficit without additional jobs the deficit may become permanent this is one reason for the importance of rebuilding if we do not replace the lost space lower manhattan never will regain the vibrancy it had as the world s financial center love them or hate them and there were lots of new yorkers on both sides of the issue the towers made a powerful statement to the world that said this is new york a symbol of our free economy and of our way of life that is why they were destroyed this is a second reason why the towers must be replaced and with buildings that make a potent architectural statement in recent weeks redevelopment proposals have been circulated from many sources most of these focus not on the trade center site however but on all of lower manhattan further many believe that the NUMBER million square feet either could be located elsewhere scattered in several sites or simply never rebuilt these proposals miss the point what was destroyed and what must be recovered was the trade center not all of lower manhattan except over the towers footprints where there must be no commercial development the office and retail space lost has to be rebuilt on or close to where it was access to mass transit makes the site ideal for office space of this size that was a major reason why the twin towers were leased to NUMBER occupancy before NUMBER NUMBER none of the other sites proposed for office development has remotely equal transportation access with the reconstruction of the subway and path stations plus an additional NUMBER NUMBER billion in transit improvements planned such as the new fulton transit center and the direct train to the plane long island rail road connection the site becomes even more the logical locus of office development and new york will need the space before NUMBER NUMBER the group of NUMBER a task force of civic leaders led by sen charles schumer and former treasury secretary robert rubin concluded that the city would need an additional NUMBER million square feet of new office space by NUMBER to accommodate the anticipated addition of NUMBER NUMBER new jobs the loss of the twin towers only heightens the need as for those who say that NUMBER million square feet of office space downtown cannot be absorbed by the real estate market i would simply point out that history shows them wrong new york now has about NUMBER million square feet of office space all new construction underway already is substantially leased up new york had NUMBER million square feet of vacant office space at the beginning of the recession in NUMBER by NUMBER this space had been absorbed at an annual rate of about NUMBER million square feet we are seeking to rebuild NUMBER million square feet on the trade center site over a period of about NUMBER years with the first buildings not coming on line until NUMBER and the project reaching completion in NUMBER this is an annual absorption rate of about a million feet much lower than the NUMBERs rate those who argue that new york cannot reabsorb office space that it previously had are saying that the city has had its day and is entering an extended period of stagnation and decline i will not accept this view nor will most new yorkers mayor michael bloomberg said in a recent interview with the new york times that the city has to do two things memorialize but also build for the future i believe that the twin towers site can gracefully accommodate and that downtown requires office and retail space of architectural significance a dignified memorial that both witnesses and recalls what happened and cultural amenities that would benefit workers as well as residents of the area the challenge to accomplish this is enormous but our

 bottom line the late senate minority leader certainly would have endorsed the meaning behind the phrase but it is questionable that he ever coined it an interesting link courtesy of the harrow report there s no written evidence so far that senator everett dirksen is the source of the infamous quote attributed to him it s kind of astounding that there is enough general social consensus NUMBER of all queries makes it a very faq and eyewitness reporting without a single written source what the essay below doesn t seem to answer though is what the earliest attributed quote in print by any other writer is i d naturally be much more skeptical if the quote emerged after his death rk URL a billion here a billion there did dirksen ever say a billion here a billion there and pretty soon you re talking real money or anything very close to that perhaps not based on an exhaustive search of the paper and audio records of the dirksen congressional center staffers there have found no evidence that dirksen ever uttered the phrase popularly attributed to him archivists undertook the search after studying research statistics showing that more than NUMBER percent of inquiries have to do with the quote or its variations here is what they examined all of the existing audio tapes of the famed ev and charlie and ev and jerry shows all newspapers clippings in the dirksen papers about NUMBER NUMBER pages of dirksen s own speech notes transcripts of his speeches and media appearances transcripts of republican leadership press conferences and dirksen s statements on the senate floor as documented in the congressional record although dirksen rarely prepared the text of a speech preferring to rely on notes he did employ brief phrases to remind him of a particular turn of phrase for example in referring to the public debt or excessive government spending dirksen would jot the word pothole to remind him to tell the following story on this occasion in reference to the debt ceiling as i think of this bill and the fact that the more progress we make the deeper we go into the hole i am reminded of a group of men who were working on a street they had dug quite a number of holes when they got through they failed to puddle or tamp the earth when it was returned to the hole and they had a nice little mound which was quite a traffic hazard not knowing what to do with it they sat down on the curb and had a conference after a while one of the fellows snapped his fingers and said i have it i know how we will get rid of that overriding earth and remove the hazard we will just dig the hole deeper congressional record june NUMBER NUMBER p NUMBER on the same occasion dirksen relied on yet another spending story one he labeled cat in the well one time in the house of representatives a colleague told me a story about a proposition that a teacher put to a boy he said johnny a cat fell in a well NUMBER feet deep suppose that cat climbed up NUMBER foot and then fell back NUMBER feet how long would it take the cat to get out of the well johnny worked assiduously with his slate and slate pencil for quite a while and then when the teacher came down and said how are you getting along johnny said teacher if you give me another slate and a couple of slate pencils i am pretty sure that in the next NUMBER minutes i can land that cat in hell if some people get any cheer our of a NUMBER billion debt ceiling i do not find much to cheer about concerning it congressional record june NUMBER NUMBER p NUMBER but there are no such reminders for the a billion here a billion there tag line as there surely should have been given dirksen s note making tendencies he spoke often and passionately about the debt ceiling federal spending and the growth of government yet there is no authoritative reference to the billion phrase the chief evidence in support of dirksen making the statement comes from people who claim to have heard him the library of congress for example cites someone s personal observation on the campaign trail as evidence the dirksen center has received calls from people who heard dirksen say those words some even providing the date of the event but cross checking that information with the records has so far turned up nothing in the way of confirmation the closest documented statement came at a joint senate house republican leadership press conference on march NUMBER NUMBER when dirksen said the favorite sum of money is NUMBER billion a billion a year for a fatter federal payroll a billion here a billion there emd papers republican congressional leadership file f NUMBER but the and pretty soon you re talking real money is missing in another close call the new york times january NUMBER NUMBER quoted dirksen look at education two and one half billion a billion for this a billion for that a billion for something else three to five billion for public works you haven t got any budget balance left you ll be deeply in the red cited in byron hulsey s everett dirksen and the modern presidents ph d dissertation may NUMBER university of texas p NUMBER of course the dirksen papers do not document completely the late senator s comments for example the center that bears his name does not have his testimony before committees their collection of congressional records ends in NUMBER omitting the last four years of dirksen s life and career he might have employed the phrase only late although witnesses claim he said it throughout his career dirksen s campaign speeches tended not to produce transcripts only sketchy notes or abbreviated newspaper accounts dirksen also held center stage before the video age meaning that many remarks particularly those in campaigns escaped capture bottom line the late senate minority leader certainly would have endorsed the meaning behind the phrase but it is questionable that he ever coined it my permanent email address is khare URL ,0

good idea this could also be a job for pNUMBERp lots of people would love to devote their spare cycles bandwidth and unblocked ip addresses to giving the chinese unfettered net access in a sense this is what the peek a booty project does URL but let s play out the next few moves good guys google enables ssl access bad guys chinese government again blocks all access to google domains good guys set up google proxies on ever changing set of hosts peek a booty bad guys ban ssl or any unlicensed opaque traffic at the national firewall good guys hide google traffic inside other innocuous looking activity bad guys require nationwide installation of client side netnannyish software good guys offer software which disables spoofs monitoring software bad guys imprison and harvest organs from people found using monitoring disabling software and on and on the best we can hope is that technological cleverness by raising the costs of oppression or by provoking intolerable oppression brings social liberalization sooner rather than later gordon original message from rohit khare khare alumni caltech edu to fork spamassassin taint org sent monday september NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER pm subject how about subsidizing ssl access to google a cheeky letter to the editors of the economist follows along with the article i was commenting on rohit in your article about chinese attempts to censor google last week the search goes on sept NUMBERth the followup correctly noted that the most subversive aspect of google s service is not its card catalog which merely points surfers in the right direction but the entire library by maintaining what amounts to a live backup of the entire world wide web if you can get to google s cache you can read anything you d like the techniques chinese internet service providers are using to enforce these rules however all depend on the fact that traffic to and from google or indeed almost all public websites is unencrypted almost all web browsers however include support for secure sockets layer ssl encryption for securing credit card numbers and the like upgrading to ssl makes it effectively impossible for a man in the middle to meddle censorship would have to be imposed on each individual computer in china the only choice left is to either ban the entire site range of ip addresses but not the kind of selective filtering reported on in the article of course the additional computing power to encrypt all this traffic costs real money if the united states is so concerned about the free flow of information why shouldn t the broadcasting board of governors sponsor an encrypted interface to google or for that matter the rest of the web to date public diplomacy efforts have focused on public sector programming for the voice of america radio sawa and the like just imagine if the us government got into the business of subsidizing secure access to private sector media instead nothing illustrates the freedom of the press as much as the wacky excess of the press itself and most of it is already salted away at google and the internet archive project on second thought i can hardly imagine this administration promoting the use of encryption to uphold privacy rights never mind best rohit khare the search goes on china backtracks on banning google up to a point sep NUMBERth NUMBER beijing from the economist print edition in chinese the nickname for google an american internet search engine is gougou meaning doggy for the country s fast growing population of internet users NUMBERm according to an official estimate it is proving an elusive creature earlier this month the chinese authorities blocked access to google from internet service providers in china apparently because the search engine helped chinese users to get access to forbidden sites now after an outcry from those users access has been restored an unusual climbdown by china s zealous internet censors hardly more sophisticated controls have now been imposed that make it difficult to use google to search for material deemed offensive to the government access is still blocked to the cached versions of web pages taken by google as it trawls the internet these once provided a handy way for chinese users to see material stored on blocked websites after the blocking of google on august NUMBERst many chinese internet users posted messages on bulletin boards in china protesting against the move their anger was again aroused last week when some chinese internet providers began rerouting users trying to reach the blocked google site to far less powerful search engines in china duncan clark the head of a beijing based technology consultancy firm bda china ltd says china is trying a new tactic in its efforts to censor the internet until recently it had focused on blocking individual sites including all pages stored on them now it seems to be filtering data transmitted to or from foreign websites to search for key words that might indicate undesirable content for example earlier this week when using eastnet a beijing based internet provider a search on google for falun gong a quasi buddhist exercise sect outlawed in china usually aborted before all the results had time to appear such a search also rendered google impossible to use for several minutes ,0

could alter notions of the mountain environment centuries ago there s probably a lot more like it yet to be found and not just bison colorado isn t the only place where glaciers and snowfields are

the ice recedes a treasure trove of human and animal artifacts is emerging extraordinarily well preserved after centuries in the deep freeze the fabrics wood bone and dna rich tissue found on the mucky fringes of the ice are revising scientists understanding of our predecessors health habits and technology and the prey they pursued it s mind boggling how many different fields are being advanced through studying these remains says johan reinhard a high altitude archaeologist and explorer in residence at the national geographic society rare spectacular finds like the frozen mummies he discovered in the andes of peru in the NUMBERs and the legendary NUMBER NUMBER year old ice man found at the edge of a receding glacier in the alps in NUMBER have offered time capsules of cultural and biological information now as the ice continues to retreat it is yielding not just occasional treasures but long records of humans and animals in the high mountains vanishing act the trick is finding such specimens before mother nature and looters take them first once uncovered frozen remains can deteriorate within hours or be gnawed by animals moreover they re often so well preserved when they emerge that people who come upon them don t even realize they re ancient that was the case when three men hunting sheep near a high glacier in british columbia canada three years ago saw what they thought was a dead animal it looked a little like sealskin buried in the ice recalls warren ward a teacher from nearby nelson but when i looked closer i could see leather fringe from a coat and finger bones figuring they had found the remains of another hunter or perhaps a fur trapper the men stowed a flint knife and other artifacts in a zip loc bag and delivered them to local officials archaeologists later exhumed the fallen hunter s body along with a woven hat fur clothing and what seemed to be a medicine bag carbon dating revealed that the hunter lived about NUMBER years ago dubbed kwaday dan ts inchi or long ago person found by people of the champagne and aishihik first nations who may be his direct descendants he is perhaps the best preserved human from the period ever found in north america other findings from melting ice in the neighboring yukon region could explain what that long ago person was doing in the mountains in the first place before this there was no archaeological record of people living here says greg hare a yukon government archaeologist now we see that this area was very much part of people s seasonal activities like ward s discovery the search began by chance when kristin benedek caught a whiff of what smelled like a barnyard as she and her husband gerry kuzyk hunted sheep at NUMBER NUMBER feet in the mountains of the south yukon they followed the scent to a melting patch of ice covered in caribou dung it was really odd because i knew there hadn t been caribou in the area for at least NUMBER years recalls kuzyk then a wildlife biologist with the yukon government caribou cake returning a week later he found what looked like a pencil with string wrapped around it it turned out to be a NUMBER NUMBER year old atlatl or spear thrower further investigation of the ice patch and scores of others around the region revealed icy layer cakes filled with caribou remains and human detritus chronicling NUMBER NUMBER years of changing hunting practices scientists now believe ancient caribou and other animals flocked to the ice each summer to cool down and escape swarming mosquitoes and flies hunters followed the game they returned for centuries and discarded some equipment in the ice we ve got people hunting with throwing darts up until NUMBER NUMBER years ago says hare who now oversees the research project then we see

came at the end of a long frustrating brown bag session at a public policy think tank here the challenge was to save the city s child care programs staring into his empty coffee cup the meeting coordinator s mind landed on an unlikely solution put a tax just a benign dime a shot on espresso that led to a petition signed by more than NUMBER NUMBER seattle residents and next year voters will decide whether the tax becomes law one that taps right into seattle s legendary addiction to coffee this is after all the town where starbucks was born and where the NUMBER pound of beans became a staple there is one starbucks for every NUMBER NUMBER residents in seattle compared to one per NUMBER NUMBER in new york seattle also has two other major coffee chains tully s coffee and seattle s best coffee as well as countless cafes and espresso carts a recent poll showed that NUMBER of seattle residents would vote for the tax for people outside of seattle who don t understand the consumption of espresso the tax proposal can be seen as crazy said john burbank the think tank s executive director but it was common sense research by his nonprofit economic opportunity institute showed that people preferred a tax on liquor or beer over one on espresso but because of the large number of lattes and cappuccinos sold a tax on espresso could be lower than one levied on alcohol burbank estimates the tax could generate NUMBER million to NUMBER million a year city council aides dispute his figures saying their research shows the tax would bring in NUMBER NUMBER million to NUMBER million a year burbank s institute is funded by foundations and labor unions the think tank s mission is to promote public policy in the interests of low income people and it has long championed child care issues burbank says the tax would restore cuts to the child care programs made earlier this year by gov gary locke he also says it would provide more low income families with subsidies for child care improve preschool programs and increase teacher salaries at bauhaus books coffee the sidewalk is dotted with tables of customers for whom coffee is a half day activity not

organized as jolt joined to oppose the latte tax among the members are seattle s chamber of commerce and the city s two largest coffee franchises starbucks and tully s the tax would force coffeehouses to track sales of any beverage that contains espresso a task that could be an administrative nightmare for smaller cafes especially during the frantic morning rush if espresso counts come under suspicion coffeehouse owners could face a city audit university of chicago economics professor michael greenstone said the tax doesn t add up the purpose of any tax is to be efficient and equitable and this is neither he said on the efficiency side it s surely going to lead to costly efforts by both businesses and consumers to find ways to avoid the tax for example starbucks could claim that they are using finely ground coffee instead of coffee run though an espresso maker and that consequently they are exempt from the tax would they be right i don t know but finding out will surely take lots of legal fees that could have gone to child care of course from a public relations perspective this is an ingenious idea and i mean that in a cynical way they ve pitted espresso drinkers against child care supporters and who s going to side with the espresso drinkers in fact the proposed tax has forced opponents into a political two step where their criticism must remain a beat behind their public stance of political correctness in a liberal city like seattle corporations continually advertise their commitment to social activism and throughout the debate over the initiative jolt members prefaced their opposition with endorsements of good child care starbucks will continue to support early learning and childhood development programs through the millions of dollars we contribute annually the company said however starbucks does not understand why the economic opportunity institute would recommend an additional consumer tax on espresso beverages or any other single consumer product the city council has yet to decide when the initiative will go before voters next year the initiative s authors say it is directed at vendors critics predict it will be passed on to consumers through higher prices effectively punishing them for their choice of coffee the tax would be applied to any drink with at least half an ounce of espresso including decaf drip coffee would be exempt burbank says the tax would reach only a pre selected group of consumers who are wealthier than those who drink drip so he s been pitching it as a modern day robin hood tax where the needy get a dime

hi everybody i m writing a web application in java tomcat jsp servlets database access with postgresql this will be released under the gpl and will eventually be useful as a framework for other web applications the application main focus is e commerce but not limited to that i would like to use some form of cryptography to protect data on the database but i have some problem figuring out the right approach above all how to store passwords and keys in a shared web server a problem that i was unable to solve is how to store keys for encryption decryption the api that i m using is the jca jdkNUMBER NUMBER x and the methods of saving generated keys in keystores fails always i can serialize the object and store in the database but this is not the most secure approach this key is needed to decrypt data in the database but the database is accessible from the web application assuming that i can find a good and secure place where to store the database password i can use a different database with different user argh to complex and doesn t really solve the problem where i can found good documentation about this topic there is another approach that i would share with the list something i thought that can be of bit interest but probabily wrong and insecure after all i m a real beginner in secure programming and i m here to learn methods and technics first of all i need a secure way to keep database passwords secure so i have to keep them separate from the main server the right approach could be using a small java bean application that run as normal user not tomcat so it is not shared with other web services or worst the nobody user that has no shell login but has a default home directory or a place where it can hold passwords and keys the web application could then open an ssl connection could be done in the init method at server startup to get database passwords the small bean could check via code signature rmi whatever else that the source is the right one and handle all the database connections or give the db connection password to the main web application in this way we solve the problem of keeping the keys and passwords in shared directories and also an attacker should get root bean user account to read data this is not perfect and works only if your provider gives the opportunity to configure a separated java application that means really another server running in the background any suggestions thank you mario torre please avoid sending me word or powerpoint attachments see URL ,0

 i d prefer to strip html tags from everything but last time i tried that it still had bad effects on the error rates in my corpora your corpora are biased in this respect though newsgroups have a strong social taboo on posting html but in many people s personal inboxes it is quite abundant getting a good ham corpus may prove to be a bigger hurdle than i though my own saved mail doesn t reflect what i receive since i save and throw away selectively much more so than in the past multipart mixed text plain brief text plus url s text html long html copied from website ah that explains why the html tags didn t get stripped i d again offer to add an optional argument to tokenize so that they d get stripped here too but if it gets glossed over a third time that would feel too much like a loss wink i ll bite sounds like a good idea to strip the html in this case i d like to see how this improves the f p rate on this corpus guido van rossum home page URL ,0

 original message from crispin cowan mailto crispin wirex com sent wednesday september NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER pm to ben mord cc webappsec securityfocus com secprog securityfocus subject re use of base image delta image for automated recovery from attacks ben mord wrote original message from crispin cowan mailto crispin wirex com sent wednesday september NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER pm to ben mord cc webappsec securityfocus com secprog securityfocus subject re use of base image delta image for automated recovery from attacks ben mord wrote my proposed solution to the first two problems you mention is to be less ambitious the idea is that you never commit instead you simply revert to base state on reboot ah in that case you can use something considerably less powerful than vmware all you need is a machine configured to boot from cd rom and use a ram disk for scratch space numerous linux distros are available that let you boot a stateless but functional system from cd rom but ram is expensive and the directory structures of many systems e g windows are not sufficiently organized and standardized to make this combination of bootable cds and ram drives practical even if you are fortunate enough to be using linux or another fhs compliant nix you still can t fit a lot on a cd its not unusual today to have gigabytes of static multimedia content on the web server this particular problem can be alleviated somewhat by using dvds but this is a temporary solution at best which will become outdated quickly as our data requirements grow and hard drives become cheaper obviously you can t do this with partitions that accrue important state e g a partition that stores database table data but if you do want some state to persist then you need a mountable writable partition to protect it you need some kind of access control management to decide who can do what to the writable partition blah blah blah and before you know it the security problem starts to look just like it does for conventional servers right this is why you would consolidate all state of any long term significance on just a couple partitions and why you would not put static application code on these changeable partitions fortunately most large client server application physical architectures do this anyhow because these are two fundamentally different kinds of state with two very different sets of administrative security raid and backup requirements people also tend to do this anyhow because layered logical architectures are popular with the gui at one end business logic in the middle and persistence services at the other this logical architecture maps naturally to a physical architecture that has a static web server a static application server and a database server that has static and changeable partitions i use the word static versus changeable instead of writeable versus unwritable because the unchangeable partitions might be written to for temporary swap space who knows what windows does internally my point is that there should be a market out there for a hardware raid device that can split designated partitions into a permanent base image partition and a temporary delta image partition that has some simple but solid security measures to prevent the unauthorized remote modification of base images and that can be configured to clear the delta image when the server is rebooted if some vendor wished to implement this they could then market this as a mechanism to help frustrate broad classes of attack that rely on the permanent modification of system or application files via buffer overflows platform and middleware bugs etc the prevention of unauthorized modification of application data of course would not be addressed by this particular product but there are many other techniques out there to defend application data but those techniques all assume that your system itself has not been compromised at a lower level which is where this product could help i would have to think that these features would be relatively easy for a hardware raid vendor to implement i m just guessing of course with no knowledge of how hardware raid works internally if anyone knows of such a product i d love to hear about it ben ,0

one of the main strands of this modernisation is to have all stations on a retained basis at night basically this means that the fire station will be unmanned and in the event of a fire the fire fighters will be summonsed by pagers the same way that they currently are in a lot of rural regions the main reason for this is that fewer fires occur at night however the majority of fatalities in fires do occur at night and the recent deaths during the fire fighters strike all occurred at night over half of these happened in areas currently covered by retained crews who aren t on strike and would appear to give a grim foreshadowing of what may be to come currently one of the conditions for being in a retained crew is that you must live work within one mile of the station how they will apply this to whole time fire fighters is still unclear a good friend of mine is a station officer in hampshire and currently lives NUMBER miles from his station so how he ll respond to fire calls at night is a mystery and i can t see many fire fighters living within a mile of some of the inner london stations dave to unsubscribe from this group send an email to forteana unsubscribe URL your use of yahoo groups is subject to URL ,0

i like this part sounds like httpd on the client URL once the client component is installed a server can order a program to run on the client any cgi script java servlet asp component etc could be run on the client this is like breaking the web server into two parts originally web servers just understood http and sent pages then the field started demanding more from the web and the servers got loaded down with cgi and mod_perl and active pages and stuff so now the web server can choose to go back to simple serving and where the application is appropriate let the client do the other razzamatazz this is superior to javascript in one important detail the program doesn t have to reload when a new page is loaded as javascript functions do and because xdegrees uses web compatible technology users can access xdegrees resources without installing any software simply by using their browser scaling is the main question that comes to mind when somebody describes a new naming and searching system ceo michael tanne claims to have figured out mathematically that the system can scale up to millions of users and billions of resources scaling is facilitated by the careful location of servers xdegrees will colocate servers at key routing points as akamai does and by directing clients to the nearest server as their default home server enterprise customers can use own servers to manage in house applications files can be cached on multiple systems randomly scattered around the internet as with napster or freenet in fact the caching in xdegrees is more sophisticated than it is on those systems users with high bandwidth connections can download portions or stripes of a file from several cached locations simultaneously the xdegrees software then reassembles these stripes into the whole file and uses digital signatures to verify that the downloaded file is the same as the original a key component of this digital signature is a digest of the file which is stored as an http header for the file ,0

 jeremy hylton i think one step towards deployment is creating a re usable tokenizer for mail messages the current codebase doesn t expose an easy to use or easy to customize tokenizer tokenize couldn t be easier to use it takes a string argument and produces a stream of tokens whether via explicit list or generator or tuple or doesn t matter all the tokenize functions in URL and URL are freely interchangeable this way note that we have no evidence to support that a customizable tokenizer would do any good or if it would in which ways customization could be helpful that s a research issue on which no work has been done the timtest module seems to contain an enormous body of practical knowledge about how to parse mail messages but the module wasn t designed for re use that s partly a failure of imagination wink splitting out all knowledge of tokenization is just a large block cut and paste there it s done change the from timtoken import tokenize at the top to use any other tokenizer now if you want to make it easier still feel free to check in something better i d like to see a module that can take a single message or a collection of messages and tokenize each one the msg and msgstream classes in URL are a start at that but it s hard to do anything truly useful here when people use all sorts of different physical representations for email msgs mboxes in various formats one file per folder one file per msg skip s gzipped gimmick if you re a python coder wink you should find it very easy to change the guts of msg and msgstream to handle your peculiar scheme defining interfaces for these guys should be done i d like to see the tokenize by customizable too tim had to exclude some headers from his test data because there were particular biases in the test data if other people have test data without those biases they ought to be able to customize the tokenizer to include them or exclude others this sounds like a bottomless pit to me and there s no easier way to customize than to edit the code as readme txt still says though massive refactoring would help hop to it ,0

 danq i think it would make more sense to start habeas with a less danq aggressive score one which will not give spammers a quick path danq into everyone s inbox and after we ve seen evidence that the danq system works then we can increase the magnitude of the score better yet let the ga figure out the correct score that will obviously take awhile since you ll have to acquire enough messages with it but it should give you a good idea if the presence of habeus headers are good spam indicators or not if they are my guess is that habeus will probably not succeed taking things further off topic does habeus charge a license fee to organizations who want to use their copyrighted material or is their sole revenue stream to come from legal judgements on the one hand if they charge license fees i d worry that when times got tough they d be somewhat less critical of organizations we d call spammers today in order to generate license fees if not i d worry the pendulum would swing the other way and they d go after legitimate businesses in an attempt to generate more revenues from judgements and or out of court settlements either way it seems like they have an interesting tightrope to walk skip montanaro skip URL consulting URL this URL email is sponsored by thinkgeek welcome to geek heaven URL _______________________________________________ spamassassin talk mailing list spamassassin talk URL URL ,0

these guides on your computer s hard disk as other people will be ordering these guides from you paying you for them and you will need to email the guides to the new buyers step NUMBER from the list of names above delete the name and address of the person shown under guide NUMBER and replace that slot with the name and address of the person from guide NUMBER s slot be sure to copy the name and address exactly as shown check the address again step NUMBER delete name and address under guide NUMBER and replace with the name and address from guide NUMBER s slot step NUMBER delete name and address under guide NUMBER and replace with the name and address from guide NUMBER s slot step NUMBER delete name and address under guide NUMBER and replace with the name and address from guide NUMBER s slot step NUMBER delete name and address under guide NUMBER and replace with your own name and address this step is how your own name and address is entered into the list of names to receive orders for the guides eventually your own name will go down the list of names until you have reached guide NUMBER and then be dropped from the list the key point is that the number of people ordering guides from you will grow larger the lower down the list your name goes step NUMBER once you have completed this new list send out this new email which shows your name under guide NUMBER to as many email addresses as possible as many as NUMBER NUMBER emails or even more the greater the number of mailings you make potentially the greater the number of people who will order the guide NUMBER from you these people will then make new emails to send out to their addresses with the email showing your name under guide NUMBER and so on this is all you need to do if you wish to read the rest of this email message then do so if not just do the NUMBER steps shown above remember the key point is to send out as many emails as possible in step NUMBER and to encourage and help those who purchase the guides from you to send out emails of their own do not change anything other than what is instructed because if you do it will not work for you your immediate reaction might be why not replace all the names on the list with the names of your spouse kids relatives and friends that might seem to you like a clever move because new buyers will be sending their money to these people but that move is the exact opposite of what is to your benefit what will benefit you most is having people who will send out emails seek new buyers and provide assistance to new buyers if the people you slip into that list aren t going to be sending new emails you re only hurting yourself by effectively closing down the program with your name on top of the list of the names that you have inserted there wouldn t be new buyers coming in so your sly maneuver will gain you exactly zero furthermore if you have done the work and your name has worked its way to further down the list by then you deserve the rewards and earnings from that effort and it would be unethical for anyone to remove your name for whatever reason don t do it to others remember honesty reaps the reward you may have a concern that after sending the total NUMBER to the five people on the list that one of the people will just take your money and not send you the guide well rest assured as we said above it s to our benefit to have you as a satisfied buyer who will actively send out emails to find new buyers so don t think the people on the list will try to cheat you or to stiff you for NUMBER NUMBER the people on the list would rather have you working hard because your effort will benefit them as well as you later on when other buyers send you the order to buy the guides fulfill your end of the deal by sending the ordered guide to the buyer don t cheat provide efficient and honest service and we will all benefit end of summary rest of message with easy to use email tools and opt in email success in this business is now well within the capabilities of ordinary people who may not have done any internet marketing before and the earnings potential is staggering read this email to the end follow what it says and you will not worry whether a recession is coming or not or whether or not you can afford to buy that new car or home that you have been looking for yes i know what you are thinking i never responded to one of these before either one day though something made me feel you use NUMBER going to a movie for NUMBER hours with your spouse friend or child plus a simple meat at a restaurant why the heck not no

receives only a NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER of NUMBER response the response could be much better but let s just say it is only NUMBER NUMBER also many people will send out hundreds of thousands of

NUMBER emails the NUMBER NUMBER response to that is NUMBER NUMBER orders for guide NUMBER or NUMBER NUMBER at NUMBER per guide this may seem a small amount to you but remember we used a very low response rate with a small number of emails being sent out see what happens if you can get the response rate up just slightly if response rate is NUMBER NUMBER income from guides NUMBER NUMBER is NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER as above if response rate is NUMBER NUMBER income from guides NUMBER NUMBER is NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER if response rate is NUMBER NUMBER income from guides NUMBER NUMBER is NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even one NUMBERth of those people mailed NUMBER NUMBER emails each or more from the example above you can see the power of leveraging that is how much greater is the amount of money from a small increase in the response rate there are over NUMBER million people on the internet worldwide and counting with thousands more coming online every day method NUMBER placing free ads on the internet advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are many free places to advertise placing a lot of free ads on the internet will get a response we strongly suggest you start with method NUMBER and add method NUMBER as you go along for every NUMBER you receive all you must do is email the guide the buyer ordered always provide same day service the people you buy these guides from will assist and advise you how to get the large number of email addresses that you need to send the new email containing your name and address in return when others buy the guides from you you also should help those buyers to resell the guides to their email addresses this will benefit you because your name would be further down the list and their new buyers will buy from you this is no different than customer service in the retail or the bricks and mortars business available guides the reason for the cash is not because this is illegal or somehow wrong it is simply about time time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or approved etc concealing it is simply so no one can see there is money in the envelope and steal it before it gets to you order each guide by its number name only always send a single NUMBER bill u s currency for each guide checks not accepted make sure the cash is hidden by wrapping it in at least NUMBER sheets of paper on one of those sheets of paper write the number the name of the guide you are ordering your email address and your name and postal address be sure to address the envelope correctly and put the proper amount of stamps to mail the envelope place your order for these guides now from the name and address list shown at the beginning of this email ________________________________________________ your success guidelines if you do not receive at least NUMBER orders for guide NUMBER within NUMBER weeks continue sending emails until you do two to three weeks after you receive NUMBER orders you should receive NUMBER orders or more for guide NUMBER if not continue advertising or sending emails until you do once you have received NUMBER or more orders for guide NUMBER you can see the program is working and cash should continue coming in this is important to remember continue to assist new buyers with advice and instruction on how to send out more emails you can keep track of progress by noting which guides people are ordering from you if you want to generate more income send another batch of emails and start the whole process again there is no limit to the income you can generate a note from the originator of this program you have just received information that can give you financial freedom to really change your life but i don t wish to kid you this requires a bit of effort you can make more money in the next few weeks and months than you have ever imagined follow the program exactly as instructed remember to email the revised copy of this email after you have put your name

on mon NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER at NUMBER NUMBER jim whitehead wrote you have not explained why the increase in coNUMBER concentrations is not contributing to increasing global temperature there are a number of reasons to think that coNUMBER is not important to controlling global temperature and that much of the coNUMBER increase may not be anthropogenic some recent research points worth mentioning recent high resolution studies of historical coNUMBER concentrations and temperatures over hundreds of thousands of years have shown a modest correlation between the two in a number of cases coNUMBER level increases are not in phase with temperature increases and actually trail the increase in temperature by a short time i e increases in temperature preceded increases in coNUMBER concentrations the more studies that are done of the geological record the more it seems that coNUMBER concentrations are correlated with temperature increases but are not significantly causative there is a lot of evidence that coNUMBER levels are regulated in a fairly stable fashion i don t believe anyone really has an authoritative answer as to exactly how this works yet with respect to absolute coNUMBER concentrations it is also important to point out that our best data to date suggests that they follow a fairly regular cycle with a period of about NUMBER NUMBER years at previous cycle peaks the concentrations were similar to what they are now if this cycle has any validity and we only have good data for NUMBER NUMBER complete cyclical periods but which look surprisingly regular in shape and time then we should be almost exactly at a peak right now as it happens current coNUMBER concentrations are within NUMBER of other previous cyclical concentration peaks for which we have good data in other words we may be adding to the coNUMBER levels but it looks a lot like we would be building a molehill on top of a mountain in the historical record at the very least there is nothing anomalous about current coNUMBER concentrations also coNUMBER levels interact with the biosphere in a manner that ultimately affects temperature again the interaction is not entirely predictable but this is believed to be one of the regulating negative feedback systems mentioned above last as greenhouse gases go coNUMBER isn t particularly potent although it makes up for it in volume in some cases gases such as water and methane have a far greater impact as greenhouse gases on a per molecule basis water vapor may actually be the key greenhouse gas something that coNUMBER only indirectly effects through its interaction with the biosphere coNUMBER was an easy mark for early environmentalism but all the recent studies and data i ve seen gives me the impression that it is largely a passenger on the climate ride rather than the driver i certainly don t think it is a healthy fixation if we re actually interested in understanding warming trends cheers james rogers jamesr URL ,0

 URL the disappearing alliance by dale franks NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER for over two generations the countries of western europe have been our closest allies we stood beside each other through the darkest days of the cold war as partners in the north atlantic treaty organization we celebrated with them over the fall of the soviet empire and the liberation of eastern europe from the yoke of communism tragically a generation from now we may be bitter adversaries europe has increasingly fallen under the spell of a political ideology that hudson institute scholar john fonte has termed progressive transnationalism the key doctrines of this form of post communist progressivism contain some fairly pernicious ideas among these are the deconstruction of nationalism the promotion of post nationalist ideas of citizenship i e a global citizenry a redefinition of democracy and the pooling of national sovereignty into multinational groups such as the united nations the european union itself a multinational organization built through the pooling of sovereignty by european nations is post democratic while there is a european parliament the eu s power resides mainly in the unelected european commission ec and its unelected president who face few limits to their power instead of a limited consensual form of government where elected representatives promulgate constitutional laws the eu has an appointed oligarchic executive along with a large attendant bureaucracy whose orders are not constitutionally limited in any real sense moreover the eu has been unwilling to accept the democratically expressed wishes of the people themselves when those wishes conflict with the results desired by the eu s political elite both the ec and the european court of justice regularly overturn the national laws of democratically elected eu member governments this is a step backward in europe s political development european criticism of america is on the rise and the european list of complaints about america is a long and growing one they dislike the fact that our republican system of government is not based on proportional representation they hate the fact that our citizens own guns they despise the fact that we execute murderers they resent the fact that our economy is so large and that americans consume so much they also resent and fear the fact that we have the ability to project american power anywhere in the world on august NUMBER NUMBER adrian hamilton wrote a column in the uk s independent newspaper in which he identified the us as a rogue state who should be restrained perhaps by a european military invasion followed by a decade or so of occupation fortunately the article is satirical not because it exaggerates the way european progressives view the us but rather because the impotence of european military power makes the idea of an invasion of the us literally fantastic at least for now despite the tongue in cheek nature of this editorial however the fact remains that america is increasingly viewed this way by the european intellectual and political elite the europeans actively desire a world where the united nations keeps in check the activities of sovereign states because they have built such a system in europe they feel it s valid for the rest of the world america however is the biggest obstacle to such a system the europeans cannot understand why america places a higher value on the ethos of national sovereignty and limited consensual and constitutional government than it does on compliance with international norms they view all departures from such norms as aberrant because the un member states all have an equal vote in prescribing international norms they assume that since the process is ostensibly legitimate the results must be as well the trouble with this idea of course is that it gives the views of non democratic authoritarian states the same weight as those of free democratic societies it sanctifies the process with no regard to the actual results thus they are unable to make any moral distinction between the us refusals to join in a given international effort because we wish to preserve the liberty of our citizens and similar refusals from iraq because its dictator wishes to maintain his firm grip on power our repeated references to the us constitution and our unwillingness to bypass its provisions to comply with international norms are incomprehensible to them they assume therefore that our refusal is based on arrogance rather than on a commitment to constitutional rights none of this bodes well for the future of euro american friendship or cooperation if the europeans continue to reject traditional liberalism in favor of the new progressivism their criticism of the us will rise while their tolerance of our differences will fall obviously in such a political atmosphere the opportunities for conflict will inevitably increase that thought is frightening enough even more

 before we get too far down this road what do people think of creating a spambayes package containing classifier and tokenizer this is just to minimize clutter in site packages too early imo if you mean to leave the various other tools out of it if and when we package this perhaps we should use barry s trick from the email package for making the package itself the toplevel dir of the distribution rather than requiring an extra directory level just so the package can be a subdir of the distro guido van rossum home page URL ,0

tim peters wrote i ve run no experiments on training set size yet and won t hazard a guess as to how much is enough i m nearly certain that the NUMBERh NUMBERs i ve been using is way more than enough though okay i believe you each call to learn and to unlearn computes a new probability for every word in the database there s an official way to avoid that in the first two loops e g for msg in spam gb learn msg true false gb update_probabilities i did that it s still really slow when you have thousands of messages in each of the last two loops the total of ham and total of spam in the learned set is invariant across loop trips and you could break into the abstraction to exploit that the only probabilities that actually change across those loop trips are those associated with the words in msg then the runtime for each trip would be proportional to the of words in the msg rather than the number of words in the database i hadn t tried that i figured it was better to find out if all but one testing had any appreciable value it looks like it doesn t so i ll forget about it another area for potentially fruitful study it s clear that the highest value indicators usually appear early in msgs and for spam there s an actual reason for that advertising has to strive to get your attention early so for example if we only bothered to tokenize the first NUMBER of a msg would results get worse spammers could exploit this including a large mime part at the beginning of the message in pratice that would probably work fine sometimes an on topic message starts well but then rambles never i remember the time when i was ten years old and went down to the fishing hole with my buddies this guy named gordon had a really huge head wait maybe that was joe well no matter as i recall it was a hot day and everyone was tired human growth hormone girl with huge breasts blah blah blah ,0

the scotsman thu NUMBER aug NUMBER meaningful sentences tracey lawson if you ever wanted to look like one of the most dangerous inmates in prison history as one judge described charles bronson now s your chance bronson the serial hostage taker not the movie star has written a health and fitness guide in which he shares some of the secrets behind his legendary muscle power solitary fitness a title which bears testament to the fact that bronson NUMBER has spent NUMBER of his NUMBER prison years in solitary confinement explains how he has turned himself into a lean mean fitness machine while living NUMBER hours a day in a space just NUMBER feet by eight feet on a diet of scrubs grub and at virtually no cost the book is aimed at those who want to get fabulously fit without spending a fortune on gym memberships protein supplements or designer trainers and starts with a fierce attack on some of the expensive myths churned out by the exercise industry i pick up a fitness mag i start to laugh and i wipe my arse with it is the opening paragraph penned by bronson it s a joke and a big con and they call me a criminal you can t help feeling he has a point this is not the first book that bronson has written from behind bars having already published birdman opens his mind which features drawings and poems created by bronson while in prison and he is not the first prisoner to discover creative expression while residing at her majesty s pleasure jimmy boyle the scots sculptor and novelist discovered his artistic talents when he was sent to barlinnie prison s famous special unit which aimed to help inmates put their violent pasts behind them by teaching them how to express their emotions artistically boyle was sentenced to life for the murder of babs rooney in NUMBER once released he moved to edinburgh where he has become a respected artist his first novel hero of the underworld was published in NUMBER and his autobiography a sense of freedom was made into an award winning film hugh collins was jailed for life in NUMBER for the murder of william mooney in glasgow and in his first year in barlinnie prison stabbed three prison officers earning him an extra seven year sentence but after being transferred to the same unit that boyle attended he learned to sculpt and developed an interest in art he later published autobiography of a murderer a frank account of glasgow s criminal culture in the NUMBERs which received critical praise and lord archer doesn t seem to have had trouble continuing to write the books that have made him millions while in jail he recently signed a three book deal with macmillan publishers worth a reported NUMBER million and is no doubt scribbling away as we speak so why is it that men like collins bronson and boyle who can be so destructive towards society on the outside can become so creative once stuck on the inside steve richards bronson s publisher has published many books about criminal figures and believes the roots of this phenomenon are both pragmatic and profound he says prison is sometimes the first time some criminals will ever have known a stable environment and this can be the first time they have the chance to focus on their creative skills it may also be the first time that they have really had the chance of an education if their early years have been hard it could be the first time anyone has offered them the chance to explore their creative talents however richards believes the reasons are also deeper than that he says once they are behind bars the cold light of day hits them and they examine the very essence of who they are they ask themselves am i a man who wants to be remembered for violence or am i a man who can contribute to society who can be remembered for something good bronson who was born michael gordon peterson but changed his name to that of the hollywood star of the death wish films has so far been remembered mainly for things bad he was originally jailed for seven years for armed robbery in NUMBER and has had a series of sentences added to his original term over the years as a result of attacking people in prison in NUMBER he was jailed for life after being convicted of holding a teacher hostage for nearly two days during a jail siege standing five feet ten and a half inches tall and weighing NUMBERlbs he is renowned for his strength he has bent metal cell doors with his bare hands and does up to NUMBER NUMBER yes NUMBER NUMBER press ups a day as he puts it i can hit a man NUMBER times in four seconds i can push NUMBER press ups in NUMBER seconds but judging by our current obsession with health and exercise solitary fitness might be the book which will see bronson s face sitting on every coffee table in the land he might be the man to give us the dream body which so many so called fitness gurus promise but fail to motivate us into because bronson has learned to use words as powerfully as he can use his fists all this crap about high protein drinks pills diets it s just a load of bollocks and a multi million pound racket he writes in what can only be described as a refreshingly honest style we can all be fat lazy bastards it s our choice i m sick of hearing and reading about excuses if you stuff your face with shit you become shit that s logical to me as motivational mantras go that might be just the kick up the er
